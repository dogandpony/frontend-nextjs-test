# Frontend Developer Test

**Welcome to our Frontend Developer Test**

This test consists of a series of tasks which may take a few hours to complete, depending on your experience level. The primary purpose of this test is to infer your __logical thinking__, __problem-solving skills__, and __fidelity to the design and prototype__.

## Project Setup Instructions

1. Create a __private__ repository.
1. Setup Next.js. Run __one__ of the following:
    - `yarn create next-app` (no TypesScript)
    - `yarn create next-app  --typescript` (with TypeScript)
1. Setup Tailwind:
    1. Follow steps 2, 3, and 4 at [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs)
1. To run the project locally, use `yarn dev`

## Scenario

To recreate the design and functionality of a generic office-listings page. Please navigate through the [interactive prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/VU2BJHrMmoSEdQmMa1EbYP/Front-end-Test?node-id=2253%3A2129&viewport=-4357%2C528%2C0.5&scaling=min-zoom) to better understand the scope and requirements.

## Tasks

1. Recreate [the design](https://www.figma.com/file/VU2BJHrMmoSEdQmMa1EbYP/Front-end-Test?node-id=2253%3A2129) and [interactive prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/VU2BJHrMmoSEdQmMa1EbYP/Front-end-Test?node-id=2253%3A2129&viewport=-4357%2C528%2C0.5&scaling=min-zoom) using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
1. Populate the office listings from a datasource (JSON or hard-coded array)
1. Recreate the following interactivity
    1. Toggle open/close office cards
    1. “Add new location” (add new office to list)
    1. “Edit office” (edit and save office data)
    1. While adding or editing an office, the “Save” button should be disabled until all fields have been validated
    1. “Delete office” (remove office from list)

Data does not need to persist (no backend needed), but if you wish, you can use localStorage for it.

## Tips

- Keep it simple
- Data persistence is not required
- Please ensure your readme file contains valid and simple instructions
- Please use placeholder data only (i.e. do not use real or identifiable information)
- Feel free to validate fields according to your own validation logic
- Verify the full functionality of your application prior to submission

## Deadline

You´ll have up to 7 consecutive days to work on the test.

Please submit your test as a __private__ Github repository URL, along with a readme file containing instructions on how to set up and run your application.

Please add [Fez](https://github.com/felipesnts) and [Bill](https://github.com/billaddison) with view access to your __private repository__.
